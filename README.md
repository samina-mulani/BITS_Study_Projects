## SOP
Involved studying the applicability of blockchain and neural networks for traffic management. A solution that targets the problem of traffic information management and traffic level prediction is proposed. VANET architecture is utilised for information collection. IPFS and a two-level blockchain are leveraged for the purpose of information storage and  security, along with a central identity registration authority. LSTM networks are utilised for traffic level prediction. Traffic information can be queried by users at anytime and in the case a congestion is detected, users in the vicinity are alerted, thus dealing with the problem of accessibility of traffic level information.

## LOP
Involved studying about Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). Routing mechanism for data delivery in IoT as described in [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-016-0536-2) paper was studied and implemented.
